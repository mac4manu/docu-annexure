## What is DocuAnnexure?
DocuAnnexure is an AI-powered document intelligence platform designed to transform static files into interactive knowledge bases. It specifically targets the "heavy lifting" associated with complex documents like scientific papers, technical manuals.
At its core, it is a Document Inference & Chat application. Unlike standard PDF readers, it uses AI vision and Large Language Models (LLMs) to "read" and understand the layout and context of your files.

Multimodal Extraction: It doesn't just scrape text; it identifies and extracts tables, formulas, and images, converting them into structured Markdown.

Centralized Knowledge: You can upload multiple documents (PDF, Word, or PowerPoint) and treat them as a single, searchable database.

Context-Aware Interface: The app features a dual-pane layout where you can view your document on one side and chat with an AI assistant on the other.

## How it Helps with Scientific Documents
Scientific papers are notoriously difficult for standard AI because they rely heavily on non-textual data. DocuAnnexure addresses these pain points specifically:   

Formula & Notation Accuracy: Because the app uses AI-powered vision to extract content, it can recognize complex mathematical equations and scientific notations that often get "garbled" by traditional Copy-Paste or basic OCR.

Data Extraction from Tables: Scientific results are often buried in dense tables. DocuAnnexure extracts these into structured formats, making it easier to ask the AI to "summarize the results in Table 3" or "compare the p-values across different trials."

Cross-Reference Analysis: If you are conducting a literature review, you can upload dozens of papers. The AI can then find connections between them, such as identifying if a methodology in Paper A contradicts a finding in Paper B.

Citations and Grounding: To prevent "hallucinations" (AI making things up), the system provides proper citations. When it answers a question about a specific theorem or data point, it points you back to the exact section of the source document.

## The Chat Experience
The chat functionality acts as a Research Assistant rather than just a search bar. You can use it to:

Simplify Complex Jargon: Ask the AI to "Explain the 'Methods' section of this paper as if I'm a first-year grad student."

Instant Summarization: Get a high-level overview of a 50-page technical annexure in seconds.

Deep Querying: Instead of searching for keywords, you can ask conceptual questions like, "What are the primary limitations the authors identified in their experimental setup?"
